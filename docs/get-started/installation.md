## Installation

To get started with pyrobh, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pyrobh
```

Or poetry:

```bash
poetry add pyrobh
```

Or rye:

```bash
rye add pyrobh
```

!> pyrobh requires pyrogram to be installed, since it's a plugin that only does monkeypatching, rather than a standalone fork of pyrogram.
